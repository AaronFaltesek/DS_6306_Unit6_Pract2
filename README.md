The goal of this project is to do some analysis on Housing Sales data from manhattan.

THe project contains two directories, Analysis and Paper. The analysis directory has a child directory, Data, which holds the csv file containing the data we are trying to analyze. The Analysis directory also has the R script files for reading in the csv file, cleaning up the data, and then running functions on the resulting data set to interpret.

The paper directory has the resulting analysis files. There is a text file with the group's analysis and there is also output from Rmarkdown tieup. These files contain the code, code's output, and interpretation of the results.
